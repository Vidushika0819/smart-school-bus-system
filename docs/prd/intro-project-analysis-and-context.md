## Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Analysis Source
Document-project output available at: docs/brownfield-architecture.md

### Current Project State
SafeGo is a full-stack web application for managing bus operations, including trips, buses, drivers, and coordinators. The backend provides REST APIs using Node.js and Express, with MongoDB as the database. The frontend is a React single-page application that consumes these APIs.

### Enhancement Scope Definition

#### Enhancement Type
Major enhancement (multiple epics) - Complete the system with authentication, role-based access, improved UI, and security fixes

#### Enhancement Description
Transform the current basic CRUD system into a complete, working bus management prototype that demonstrates MERN stack concepts. Add user authentication, role-based dashboards (admin, coordinator/conductor, driver), improved UI/UX with responsive web design, proper data validation, security fixes (password hashing), and features suitable for university assignment evaluation.

#### Impact Assessment
Significant Impact (substantial existing code changes) - Requires adding authentication system, modifying all UI components, updating data models, implementing role-based access control, and fixing security vulnerabilities.

### Goals and Background Context

#### Goals
- Create a complete, working bus management system prototype
- Demonstrate key MERN stack concepts and best practices
- Provide role-based access for different user types (admin, coordinator, driver)
- Ensure the system is easy to demonstrate and evaluate
- Fix security issues and implement proper authentication
- Create clean, well-structured, and commented code

#### Background Context
This is a university assignment requiring a transportation management system prototype. The system needs to showcase core functionality of a bus management application while demonstrating web development concepts. The focus is on educational value and clear demonstration of MERN stack principles rather than production-level robustness.
