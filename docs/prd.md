m # SafeGo Brownfield Enhancement PRD

## Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Analysis Source
Document-project output available at: docs/brownfield-architecture.md

### Current Project State
SafeGo is a full-stack web application for managing bus operations, including trips, buses, drivers, and coordinators. The backend provides REST APIs using Node.js and Express, with MongoDB as the database. The frontend is a React single-page application that consumes these APIs.

### Enhancement Scope Definition

#### Enhancement Type
Major enhancement (multiple epics) - Complete the system with authentication, role-based access, improved UI, and security fixes

#### Enhancement Description
Transform the current basic CRUD system into a complete, working bus management prototype that demonstrates MERN stack concepts. Add user authentication, role-based dashboards (admin, coordinator/conductor, driver), improved UI/UX with responsive web design, proper data validation, security fixes (password hashing), and features suitable for university assignment evaluation.

#### Impact Assessment
Significant Impact (substantial existing code changes) - Requires adding authentication system, modifying all UI components, updating data models, implementing role-based access control, and fixing security vulnerabilities.

### Goals and Background Context

#### Goals
- Create a complete, working bus management system prototype
- Demonstrate key MERN stack concepts and best practices
- Provide role-based access for different user types (admin, coordinator, driver)
- Ensure the system is easy to demonstrate and evaluate
- Fix security issues and implement proper authentication
- Create clean, well-structured, and commented code

#### Background Context
This is a university assignment requiring a transportation management system prototype. The system needs to showcase core functionality of a bus management application while demonstrating web development concepts. The focus is on educational value and clear demonstration of MERN stack principles rather than production-level robustness.

Role-based dashboards will extend the existing navigation structure, maintaining the current routing approach with React Router. Form components will be enhanced with validation feedback while preserving the existing input styling patterns.

### Modified/New Screens and Views

- **New: Login Page** - Authentication interface with role selection
- **New: Admin Dashboard** - Comprehensive overview with management widgets for all entities
- **New: Coordinator Dashboard** - Focused on trip and bus management with assignment tools
- **New: Driver Dashboard** - Simplified view for trip information and status updates
- **Modified: All CRUD Forms** - Enhanced with validation, better UX, and role-appropriate fields
- **Modified: Navigation** - Updated to include authentication state and role-based menu options
- **New: Profile/Settings Page** - User account management for all roles

### UI Consistency Requirements

- Maintain existing component structure and naming conventions
- Preserve current color scheme and basic styling approach
- Ensure responsive design works on desktop browsers as primary target
- Keep navigation patterns consistent across role-based dashboards
- Maintain form layout consistency while adding validation indicators
- Ensure error messages and success feedback follow consistent styling

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: JavaScript (Node.js backend, React frontend)
**Frameworks**: Express.js 5.1.0 (backend), React 19.1.1 (frontend)
**Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM 8.18.0
**Authentication**: None currently (to be added)
**Frontend Libraries**: Axios 1.11.0 for API calls, React Router 7.9.3 for routing
**Development Tools**: Nodemon 3.1.10 for backend development

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: Extend existing Mongoose models with authentication fields, maintain current schema relationships
**API Integration Strategy**: Add authentication middleware to existing routes, implement role-based authorization checks
**Frontend Integration Strategy**: Add authentication context and protected routes, modify existing components for role-based rendering
**Testing Integration Strategy**: Add basic authentication tests while maintaining existing manual testing approach

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: Add authentication models, middleware, and services following existing backend/Controllers and frontend/components patterns
**Naming Conventions**: Maintain existing camelCase for JavaScript, PascalCase for React components
**Coding Standards**: Follow existing patterns (async/await, error handling with try/catch, consistent imports)
**Documentation Standards**: Add JSDoc comments for new authentication functions, maintain existing inline comments approach

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: No changes needed - existing npm scripts sufficient
**Deployment Strategy**: Maintain current manual deployment approach
**Monitoring and Logging**: Add basic authentication logging to existing console-based approach
**Configuration Management**: Add environment variables for JWT secrets and session configuration

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**: Password hashing implementation complexity, role-based authorization edge cases, session management security
